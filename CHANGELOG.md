# Changelog

All notable changes to `@cross-deck/swift` will be documented in
this file. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.4.5] — 2026-05-26

SwiftUI screen tracking — the iOS half of "log in tomorrow morning
and see what users tapped on yesterday."

**Added:**

- **`View.crossdeckScreen("Name")`** — public SwiftUI modifier that
  fires `page.viewed` with `{ screen, title }` properties when the
  view appears. SwiftUI's view tree hides class names from the
  iOS SDK's swizzle-based auto-track (the host is always
  `UIHostingController<…>`, denylisted for the right reason), so
  pure-SwiftUI apps emitted zero `page.viewed` events. One line
  per screen and the Pages dashboard populates the same way it
  does for a web app's URL list. Matches the pattern Mixpanel /
  Amplitude / PostHog ship on iOS; pairs with the Pages-backend
  change that groups by `screen` when `url` / `path` are absent.
  Properties are also forwarded through `cd.track(...)` so the
  standard coercion + size guard apply.

No behavioural change to existing UIKit auto-track — UIKit screens
keep firing `page.viewed` automatically via the
`UIViewController.viewDidAppear` swizzle (unchanged).

## [1.4.4] — 2026-05-26

Bank-grade SwiftUI integration polish. The Quickstart snippet now
pastes and runs end-to-end without the developer having to
hand-roll any wiring.

**Added:**

- **`EnvironmentValues.crossdeck`** — public SwiftUI environment key
  shipped by the SDK. Consumers can now write
  `ContentView().environment(\.crossdeck, cd)` at the App root and
  `@Environment(\.crossdeck) private var cd` inside any view, with
  zero `EnvironmentKey` boilerplate on the consumer side. Returns
  `Crossdeck?` so the optional-chain pattern at every call site
  keeps the host app crash-proof when the SDK didn't start. Lives
  under `#if canImport(SwiftUI)` so non-Apple-platform resolves
  still compile.
- **`CrossdeckEnvironment`** — public typealias for the SDK's
  `Environment` enum. Avoids the symbol collision every SwiftUI
  consumer hits the moment they `import Crossdeck` alongside
  `import SwiftUI` (SwiftUI's own `Environment` property wrapper).
  The bare `Environment` name stays exported for back-compat and
  keeps working unqualified in files that don't import SwiftUI.

**Changed:**

- Quickstart snippet (dashboard SDKs page → iOS) now uses
  `CrossdeckEnvironment` in place of bare `Environment`, so the
  copy-pasted boot code compiles cleanly inside a `@main App`
  file that also imports SwiftUI.

No behavioural change; both additions are purely ergonomic surface
that closes the "first dogfood paste-and-run" friction loop.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-05-26

Patch — second consumer compile fix surfaced by the same dogfood
project as v1.4.2. With v1.4.2's `idempotentReplay` field in place,
Swift's type-checker progressed further and pinned a separate
issue in `Crossdeck.init(options:)`:

The auto-tracked `purchases/sync` failure path's debug-logger call
passed `typed.statusCode as Any` into a `[String: String]` dict
literal. `debugLogger` is typed `(DebugSignal, [String: String]) ->
Void` (Stripe-style structured-payload contract — no `Any` smuggled
through the diagnostic surface). The dict literal rejected the
`Any` cast and emitted two cascading errors.

**Fixed:**

- `Crossdeck.swift:614` — replace `typed.statusCode as Any` with
  `typed.statusCode.map(String.init) ?? "n/a"`. `statusCode` is
  `Int?` — when present we stringify, when absent we emit `"n/a"`
  so the structured key is always populated.

No behavioural change; the debug payload now strictly conforms to
the typed shape the rest of the SDK already uses. Bundled
contracts (`Resources/contracts.json`) regenerated so `bundledIn`
stamps `@cross-deck/swift@1.4.3`.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-26

Patch — fix consumer compile error caused by a missing field on
`PurchaseResult`. Surfaced when the first iOS dogfood project pulled
v1.4.1 via SwiftPM and Xcode rejected the SDK source with two
cascading errors in `syncPurchases(...)`:

- `Value of type 'PurchaseResult' has no member 'idempotent_replay'`
- `Cannot convert value of type 'Any' to expected dictionary value
  type 'String'` (cascade — the Swift type-checker gives up on
  `[String: Any]` inference once a member resolves unknown)

**Fixed:**

- `PurchaseResult` gains `public let idempotentReplay: Bool?` with
  a `CodingKey` mapping the Swift-idiomatic camelCase property to
  the wire's `idempotent_replay` (snake_case, set by the backend's
  idempotency-response-cache middleware on cache-hit retries per
  the `idempotency-key-deterministic` contract).
- `syncPurchases(...)` now reads `result.idempotentReplay`. The
  analytics event property key stays `idempotent_replay` on the
  wire so dashboards joining `purchase.completed` across SDKs see
  the same key Web/Node/RN/Android already emit.

No new API surface; no behavioural change beyond the typed access
unlocking what the runtime was already receiving. Bundled
contracts (`Resources/contracts.json`) regenerated so `bundledIn`
stamps `@cross-deck/swift@1.4.2`.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-26

Patch — close the dogfood-surfaced gap on the
`per-user-cache-isolation` contract. v1.4.0 registered the contract
with `applies_to: ["web", "react-native"]` because Swift + Android
only shipped the in-memory wipe layer of the three-layer bank-grade
isolation — physical per-user storage keys + the clearAll-via-index
logout wipe were missing.

**Implemented in v1.4.1 (now in the contract's applies_to list):**
- `EntitlementCache.setUserKey(userId)` /
  `setUserKeySync(userId)` flip the persistent storage suffix to
  `sha256(userId)` so each user's blob lives under
  `crossdeck:entitlements:<hash>` — a user-switch on a shared
  device CANNOT cross-read prior user's data even if the
  in-memory wipe is somehow skipped.
- `EntitlementCache.clearAll()` reads the persisted suffix index
  and wipes every per-user slot — used by `Crossdeck.reset()` so
  a logout on a shared device cannot leave another user's
  entitlements readable.
- `Crossdeck.identify(userId)` calls `setUserKeySync(userId)`
  instead of `clearSync()`.
- `Crossdeck.reset()` (async) calls `clearAll()` instead of
  `clear()`.

No public API breakage; existing `identify()` / `reset()`
semantics upgrade from "in-memory only" to the full three-layer
contract.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-26

**Bank-grade reconciliation release.** 6-pillar KPMG-style audit
closed across SDK + backend. Every behavioural guarantee registered
in the monorepo's `contracts/` directory with a CI-enforced audit job.

### Added

- **`PurchaseAutoTrack` purchase durability.** `transaction.finish()`
  is now called STRICTLY inside the success branch of the backend
  sync. Pre-1.4.0 it fired regardless of outcome — a 5xx mid-process-
  death silently lost the purchase. Failed syncs persist to a new
  `PendingPurchaseQueue` (max 5 in-process retries, exp backoff
  30s/1m/5m/30m/2h).
- **Proper `appAccountToken` UUID conformance.** Derived from
  `developerUserId` via `AppAccountTokenDerivation` (UUID
  passthrough, else UUID v5 from URL namespace + `crossdeck:<id>`,
  else omit). Numeric StoreKit `originalTransactionId` now rides
  in its own dedicated wire field — pre-1.4.0 it was stuffed into
  the UUID-shaped `appAccountToken`, violating Apple's StoreKit
  contract.
- **Deterministic `Idempotency-Key` on `syncPurchases()`** — same
  JWS → same key. Cross-SDK parity oracle CI-pinned.
- **`PurchaseResult.idempotent_replay?: Bool`** — true when the
  backend replayed a cached response.
- **`purchase.completed` on every successful manual
  `syncPurchases()`** — funnel parity with auto-track.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`reset()` is now `async`**. Awaits identity / entitlements /
  super-properties / breadcrumbs clear before returning. New
  `isResetting` tombstone flips synchronously at entry; `isEntitled`
  honours it and returns false during the clear window — closes
  the race between a logout button firing reset() and the actor-
  internal clear completing. `resetSync()` exists for callers that
  cannot await.
- **`stop()` is now `async`**. Awaits `queue.persistAll()` and
  cancels stored boot + heartbeat Tasks. Pre-1.4.0 the Tasks ran
  fire-and-forget against actors of stopped clients. `stopSync()`
  exists for tests / deinit paths.
- **`CrossdeckErrorType.internalError` / `.configurationError`
  added; `.apiError` / `.unknown` deprecated** with `@available(*,
  deprecated, renamed:)`. Backend's `ApiErrorType` never emitted
  `"api_error"` or `"unknown_error"` on the wire — native pattern-
  matching on the deprecated cases only matched the SDK-synthesised
  fallback, never a real backend envelope. Use `.internalError`
  for 5xx responses.

### Added (continued)

- **`NSNotificationCenter` observer cleanup in `stop()`.** Pre-1.4.0
  every start→stop→start cycle leaked N orphan observers; each
  subsequent didEnterBackground fired N stacked queue.flush() against
  dead Crossdecks. Stored tokens, removed via
  `uninstallLifecycleObservers()`.
- **`ErrorCapture.shared.uninstall()` called in `stop()`.** Pre-1.4.0
  the global exception handler retained queue/identity/consent/
  breadcrumb actors of the stopped client; next uncaught exception
  shipped through dead actors.
- **Super-property merge order matches Web/Node/RN** — device <
  super < caller. Pre-1.4.0 Swift had it inverted (super < device <
  caller, so device clobbered super-properties).
- **Default event-queue flush interval is now 2000ms** (was 5000ms)
  — cross-SDK parity.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-25

Bank-grade identity lock — the Apple Bundle ID is now sent on
every request and enforced server-side, mirroring the Origin
lock the Web SDK has always had.

### Added — Apple Bundle ID identity claim

Every HTTP request the SDK fires now carries an
`X-Crossdeck-Bundle-Id` header sourced from
`Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier` — the OS-canonical ID Apple itself
uses for App Store identity.

The Crossdeck backend's `isBundleIdAllowed()` validator enforces
this against the bundleId stored on the iOS app key. Requests
without the header, or with a mismatched value, are rejected
with `403 / bundle_id_not_allowed`.

Bank-grade contract — same shape as the Web SDK's Origin lock:
- empty stored bundleId on the key → request rejected
- missing header on the request → request rejected
- exact-match required (case-sensitive — Apple's own convention)

### Migration

Customers must:
1. Bump SPM Dependency Rule to v1.3.0.
2. Rebuild + resubmit to App Store Connect.
3. Confirm `apps.ios.bundleId` is set on the project's iOS app
   in the Crossdeck dashboard (Apps → Bundle ID editor).

Apps shipped with v1.2.0 or earlier will start receiving 403s
once the backend enforcement deploys, because they don't send
the new header.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-25

Full bank-grade parity with the Web/Node/RN SDKs. v1.1.0 closed the
ergonomics gap (non-throwing track/identify/reset); v1.2.0 closes
every remaining gap that a serious customer would notice — auto-
tracking, performance vitals, mobile lifecycle, App Store privacy
manifest, and ambient signal modules.

### Added — Auto-tracking (sessions + screens + taps)

Cross-platform event vocabulary identical to Web SDK so a single
dashboard query returns Web + iOS + Android rows uniformly:

- `session.started` / `session.ended` with `sessionId` + `durationMs`.
  30-minute idle threshold matches GA4 / Mixpanel / Web SDK
  convention — a quick app-switch keeps the same session.
- `page.viewed` — fires automatically on every `UIViewController.viewDidAppear`
  via method swizzling. Skips framework hosts (UINavigationController,
  UIHostingController, _SwiftUI types). 250ms dedup window collapses
  push/pop animation double-fires.
- `element.clicked` — fires on every UIControl action (UIButton,
  UISwitch, UISlider, UISegmentedControl) AND on SwiftUI button taps
  via UIWindow.sendEvent capture. Captures accessibilityLabel,
  accessibilityIdentifier, class name, viewport coordinates.

Every event is enriched with the current `sessionId` so funnels work
without explicit instrumentation.

Privacy guardrails baked in:
- Secure text fields, accessibility labels containing `password` /
  `card` / `ssn` / `credit` / `cvv` / `pin` are skipped silently.
- Opt-out per element via `accessibilityIdentifier` containing
  `cd-noTrack` — Mixpanel-style convention familiar to iOS devs.
- 100ms tap-coalesce defeats React-Native-style double-fires.

Configurable via `CrossdeckOptions(autoTrack: .off)` for strict-
consent flows, or feature-grained:

```swift
CrossdeckOptions(
    autoTrack: AutoTrackConfig(
        sessions: true,
        screenViews: true,
        taps: false,  // disable tap autocapture only
        sessionResumeThresholdSeconds: 30 * 60
    )
)
```

### Added — PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy bundled in the SDK

Apple began enforcing the required-reason API manifest at App Store
Connect submit in May 2024. Without one, every embedding app is
rejected. Crossdeck now ships its own `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`
declaring:
- `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults` reason `CA92.1`
- `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategorySystemBootTime` reason `35F9.1`
- `NSPrivacyTracking: false` (we do not link identity across third
  parties)

Consumer apps inherit the manifest automatically via SPM's resource
copy — no copy-paste, no one-off rejections.

### Added — MetricKit performance vitals (opt-in)

Mirrors Web SDK's `web-vitals.ts`. Set
`CrossdeckOptions(enablePerformanceMonitoring: true)` to receive:
- `perf.metrics` — daily aggregate (cold launch samples, resume
  samples, hang samples, peak memory, cumulative CPU).
- `perf.hang` — near-real-time UI-blocked diagnostics with
  hangDuration + metadata.
- `perf.cpu_exception` — sustained CPU spike diagnostics.
- `perf.disk_write_exception` — high-volume disk write diagnostics.
- `perf.crash_diagnostic` — MetricKit's process-fatal exception
  pipeline (complement to `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler`).

iOS 14+ / macOS 12+. Off by default — payload size is meaningful and
not every customer wants the signal.

### Added — Proactive network-edge flush

`NWPathMonitor` watches reachability. On `offline → online`
transitions, the event queue flushes immediately instead of waiting
for the next 5-second timer. Closes the latency gap on intermittent
connections (subway, airplane mode toggle).

ON by default via `CrossdeckOptions(enableReachabilityFlush: true)`.
iOS 12+ / macOS 10.14+.

### Added — Automatic StoreKit 2 purchase tracking (opt-in)

`CrossdeckOptions(automaticPurchaseTracking: true)` installs a
`Transaction.updates` AsyncSequence consumer. Every signed
transaction (purchase, restore, renewal, refund, family-shared)
flows to `/purchases/sync` via the same HTTP path `syncPurchases()`
uses AND fires a public funnel event:
- `purchase.completed` for new transactions
- `purchase.refunded` for revoked transactions (carries
  revocationReason)
- `purchase.unverified` for transactions Apple's signature check
  fails — fraud-signal candidate, never synced to backend

iOS 15+. Off by default because most apps already invoke
`syncPurchases()` from their own confirmation flow.

### Added — Deep-link + push interaction tracking helpers

Public API surface for the consumer to forward intent from their
SceneDelegate / UNUserNotificationCenter:
- `cd.trackDeepLink(url:source:)` — extracts UTM + click-id query
  parameters (gclid, fbclid, msclkid, ttclid, li_fat_id, twclid)
  as top-level properties. Fires `deeplink.opened`.
- `cd.trackPushReceived(userInfo:)` / `trackPushInteraction(userInfo:actionIdentifier:)`
  — surfaces marketing-platform IDs (campaign_id, message_id, etc.)
  without logging the alert body. Fires `push.received` /
  `push.interacted`.

### Fixed — `willTerminate` flush observer

Force-quit from the app switcher previously lost up to one batch
of queued events. v1.2.0 observes `UIApplication.willTerminateNotification`
and runs `queue.persistAll()` so the events land on disk before
the process dies. Next launch's queue rehydration ships them.

### Fixed — macOS / watchOS lifecycle parity

`Cmd+Q` on a Mac Catalyst or pure-AppKit Crossdeck client previously
fell off the lifecycle hook (only UIKit was wired). v1.2.0 adds
`NSApplication.willTerminateNotification` + `WKExtension.applicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification`
branches so every Apple OS the SDK targets has a persist-on-suspend
guarantee.

### Migration

None required. All new modules are additive or default-OFF where
they could be surprising. v1.1.0 call sites compile clean against
v1.2.0.

To benefit from auto-tracking, no code change — start using the
defaults. Customers who want to disable a specific signal:

```swift
CrossdeckOptions(
    // …
    autoTrack: AutoTrackConfig(taps: false),
    enableReachabilityFlush: false,
    enablePerformanceMonitoring: false,    // already default
    automaticPurchaseTracking: false        // already default
)
```

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-25

Fire-and-forget API ergonomics — matches Mixpanel / Amplitude /
Sentry / Firebase Analytics iOS conventions. Dogfood feedback flagged
that requiring `try?` at every analytics call site is hostile in
Swift even though Web/Node/RN's `track()` throw — Swift's
compile-time enforcement makes the same shape user-hostile.

### Changed — `track`, `identify`, `reset` no longer throw

The three most-called methods now have non-throwing signatures.
Validation intent is unchanged; only the Swift-side signalling
mechanism is now idiomatic.

```diff
- try? cd?.track("paywall_seen")            // v1.0.x — Swift required try?
+ cd?.track("paywall_seen")                 // v1.1.0 — clean call site

- try? cd?.identify(userId: "user_123")     // v1.0.x
+ cd?.identify(userId: "user_123")          // v1.1.0

- try? cd?.reset()                          // v1.0.x
+ cd?.reset()                               // v1.1.0
```

Validation failures (empty event name, empty userId, called after
`stop()`) now:
- Log a warning via `debugLogger` with a `*_dropped` key naming
  the failure code.
- Trigger `assertionFailure` in Debug builds — loud during dev,
  silent no-op in Release. Aligns with Apple's first-party SDK
  conventions (UserDefaults, URLSession, OSLog: none throw on
  invalid arguments).
- Skip the actual work — the call becomes a no-op.

### Migration

This is a soft break. All v1.0.x callers still compile:
- `try? cd.track(...)` → compiles with a "no calls to throwing
  functions" warning. Drop the `try?` to clean up.
- `try cd.track(...)` inside a `do/catch` → compiles but the
  catch becomes unreachable (warning). Drop both `try` and
  the catch.
- Plain `cd.track(...)` (the v1.1.0 idiom) → compiles clean.

The non-throwing methods are:
- `track(_:properties:)`
- `identify(userId:email:traits:)`
- `reset()`

Still throwing (legitimate runtime failure modes):
- `Crossdeck.start(options:)` — config validation
- `identifyAndWait(userId:email:traits:)` — network round-trip + cdcust_ return
- `forget()` — network round-trip
- `getEntitlements()` — network round-trip
- `syncPurchases(rail:...)` — network round-trip
- `flush()`, `heartbeat()` — network round-trip

### Cross-SDK consistency

Web/Node/RN's `track()` keep their throwing signature because in
JavaScript, an uncaught throw propagates to the global error handler
without requiring `try`/`catch` at every call site. The platform
contract is "track validates input and signals failure for empty
name" — Swift's signalling is now language-idiomatic
(`assertionFailure` + debug log) instead of `throws`.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-25

Critical compile-fix release. v1.0.0–v1.0.2 declared `iOS(.v13)` in
`Package.swift` but `defaultDebugLogger()` used Apple's modern
`Logger` API, which is iOS 14 / macOS 11 / tvOS 14 / watchOS 7+.
Apps with a deployment target below those minimums failed to compile
the SDK with `'Logger' is only available in iOS 14.0 or newer`.

### Fixed

- `defaultDebugLogger()` now branches on availability. iOS 14+ uses
  `Logger` with structured `privacy: .public` interpolation; older
  OS versions fall back to the legacy `os_log` family (iOS 10+).
  Signal vocabulary identical; Console.app filtering on the
  `com.crossdeck.sdk` subsystem works on both paths.
- Package now compiles against any deployment target ≥ iOS 13 —
  same floor `Package.swift` has always claimed.

### Notes

- No API changes. Strictly additive availability gate.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-25

Dogfood pass on the v1.0.1 surface. One additive API change to close
the biggest friction point a first-time Swift dev hit walking the
install path; everything else is documentation / snippet polish that
ships on cross-deck.com.

### Added

- **`Crossdeck.current`** — process-singleton accessor. Returns the
  most-recently-started client, or `nil` before `start` has succeeded
  in this process / after the current client's `stop` is called.
  Thread-safe via an `NSLock`; safe to read from any actor or queue.

  ```swift
  // Anywhere outside a SwiftUI view (services, view models,
  // AppDelegate, Combine pipelines, background workers):
  Crossdeck.current?.identify(userId: user.id, email: user.email)
  Crossdeck.current?.track("paywall_seen")
  if Crossdeck.current?.isEntitled("pro") == true { … }
  ```

  Inside SwiftUI views, keep using `@Environment(\.crossdeck)` — it
  participates in dependency tracking and is the idiomatic answer
  for view bodies. The static accessor is for the 50% of the
  codebase that isn't a View.

  Bank-grade discipline: `stop()` clears the slot iff the stopped
  instance is the one currently advertised, so concurrent
  start+stop sequences on a second client never clobber the first
  client's slot.

### Changed

- No behaviour changes. Public API is strictly additive — every
  v1.0.1 caller continues to compile and behave identically.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-25

KPMG/PwC-grade audit pass on the v1.0.0 surface. Every finding the
audit flagged is closed in this release. Plus one critical
cross-SDK canonical rename so the Swift identity surface matches
the Web/Node/RN role-model contract exactly.

### Breaking — identity API renamed to match the platform contract

The v1.0.0 identify signature drifted from Web/Node/RN. v1.0.1
restores zero-drift parity. Migration is a one-line change:

```diff
- try? cd.identify(customerId: "user_847", traits: ["email": "wes@example.com", "plan": "pro"])
+ try? cd.identify(userId: "user_847", email: "wes@example.com", traits: ["plan": "pro"])
```

Specifically:

- `customerId:` → `userId:`. The previous name collided with
  `crossdeckCustomerId` (the cdcust_… canonical handle), confusing
  the mental model. The Web/Node/RN SDKs all use `userId`.
- `email` is now a first-class top-level argument. Previously it
  was buried inside `traits` and missed the bank-grade
  identity-merge that the Web SDK gets when email is shipped
  separately. Now hoisted to the wire as `$email` on the
  `$identify` event, matching Web/Node/RN.
- Internal `customerId` field on `Identity` renamed to
  `developerUserId` everywhere — the same name Web/Node/RN's
  `Diagnostics.developerUserId` uses.
- Wire event field renamed from `customer_id` to
  `developer_user_id` (also matches what the backend ingest
  expects).
- `EntitlementSnapshot.customerId` → `developerUserId`.
- `Identity.setCustomerIdSync(...)` → `setDeveloperUserIdSync(...)`.
- Error code `missing_customer_id` → `missing_user_id`.

The Swift SDK doc now ships native auth-provider code blocks for
Sign In with Apple, Firebase Auth iOS, and Auth0 iOS, matching
the Web SDK doc's coverage of Firebase / NextAuth / Clerk /
Supabase / Auth0 / custom backends.

### Added — sync paywall reads

- `Crossdeck.isEntitled(_:)` — synchronous bool check scoped to the
  currently identified customer. Safe to call from SwiftUI bodies
  and UIKit tap handlers. Never blocks on network.
- `Crossdeck.entitlementsForCurrentCustomer()` — synchronous set
  read. Returns nil if no customer is identified or the cache is
  cold for them.
- Internally backed by NSLock-protected mirror boxes on
  `EntitlementCache`, `Identity`, `SuperProperties`, and
  `ConsentManager`. Every actor mutation updates its sync mirror
  atomically; reads acquire the lock only.

### Fixed — bank-grade contract violations

- **NSException handler now chains into the prior handler.**
  Previous v1.0.0 overwrote the global handler, silently breaking
  Crashlytics / Sentry / Bugsnag for any consumer who turned on
  `captureUncaughtExceptions`. `ErrorCapture.install` now captures
  `NSGetUncaughtExceptionHandler()` before registering ours and
  invokes the prior handler after our snapshot.
- **PII scrubber runs on `$error` events.** Previously the error
  pipeline bypassed the scrubber — a `try?` that surfaced
  `"user jane@example.com not found"` shipped raw. Now every
  scrubbable field on the wire `$error` payload (message, stack
  symbols, breadcrumb messages + data) is run through the
  configured scrubber when `consent.scrubPII` is true.
- **Breadcrumbs attached to `$error` events.** Previously collected
  but dropped before enqueue. Now ship as
  `error.breadcrumbs: [{timestamp_ms, category, level, message, data}]`
  on the wire payload.
- **`identify(...)` unconditionally clears the entitlement cache.**
  Previous v1.0.0 only cleared on `didChange || priorId == nil`.
  Now identifies always clear, matching the documented contract
  that prevents stale entitlement leaks across customer switches.
- **Self-request skip wired into `captureError(_:)`.** Errors whose
  URL host matches the configured ingest endpoint are dropped
  before processing — closes the feedback loop where a custom-
  middleware-wrapped ingest failure would generate an `$error`
  event that itself fails, ad infinitum.
- **`track()` / `identify()` race fixed.** The pre-existing pattern
  read identity inside a Task, racing concurrent identify Tasks.
  Now reads identity synchronously on the caller's thread before
  spawning the enqueue task. Deterministic ordering between
  identify and a subsequent track.
- **Empty key validation on super-properties.** `register("", v)`
  and `registerOnce("", v)` previously wrote a null-key entry
  that landed on every wire event; now silently rejected at the
  boundary.

### Fixed — privacy + correctness

- **Errors-consent gate.** The error pipeline now honours
  `consent.errors` — previously only the analytics pipeline
  observed consent. Consumers can independently allow analytics
  while denying error capture (or vice versa).
- Removed dead code: stale `(anon, cust)` tuple in error capture
  + unused NSRange in `scrubPII`.

### Tests

- **+19 new tests** (53 → 72 total). Coverage added for: sync
  paywall reads from any thread, identify cache clearing under
  same-id idempotent calls, identify cache clearing across
  customer switches, `stop()` rejecting subsequent calls
  (idempotent stop), URL-stub HTTP tests covering 2xx success,
  4xx permanent (400/401/422), 5xx retryable, 408 retryable,
  429 + Retry-After honoured, Idempotency-Key shipped verbatim
  in the request header, User-Agent header carries SDK name +
  version.

### Notes

- Public API is additive — every v1.0.0 caller still compiles.
- The `Crossdeck` class remains `@unchecked Sendable` with a
  detailed safety comment explaining the lock pattern.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-24

Initial release. Brings the Crossdeck Swift SDK to the same
bank-grade contract as the Web and Node SDKs.

### Event ingestion

- Durable, deduplicated, batched event queue. Pending batch lives in
  a dedicated slot held across retries — a crash mid-flight does
  NOT lose the batch; it rehydrates from `UserDefaults` on relaunch
  and re-sends with the original `Idempotency-Key`.
- 4xx hard stop. Permanent failures (`invalid_request_error`,
  `authentication_error`, `permission_error`) drain through the
  `onPermanentFailure` callback and never block newer events.
- `Retry-After` honoured even above the local `maxMs`, clamped at
  24h as a sanity ceiling against pathological server responses.
- Buffer overflow drops OLDEST events, preserving the most-recent
  diagnostic signal.

### Error capture

- Uncaught `NSException` handler installs an SDK-aware bridge.
- Manual `captureError(...)` for handled errors. Both paths attach
  a normalised stack + breadcrumb ring buffer.
- `beforeSend` hook for per-error filter / mutation (return `nil`
  to drop).
- Self-request detection: HTTP failures against the SDK's own
  ingest endpoint are skipped to prevent feedback loops.

### Identity + entitlements

- `anonymousId` persisted in `UserDefaults`, regenerated only on
  `reset()`.
- `identify(...)` unconditionally clears the entitlement cache so
  a switched-customer never inherits the prior user's entitlements.
- Entitlement cache scoped on `(customerId, entitlements)` — reads
  for a different customer return `nil`, never the wrong set.

### Privacy

- PII scrubber on by default. `<email>` and `<card>` tokens (angle-
  bracketed) match the platform-wide vocabulary across Web/Node/RN
  and backend.
- Recursive walk over nested dictionaries + arrays.
- Default-deny consent state: both analytics and errors off until
  the consumer opts in via `setConsent(...)`.

### Concurrency

- Strict concurrency enabled in `Package.swift`.
- All shared mutable state lives behind Swift actors (`EventQueue`,
  `Identity`, `EntitlementCache`, `SuperProperties`, `Breadcrumbs`,
  `ConsentManager`).
- All cross-actor types are `Sendable`.

### Platforms

- iOS 13+, iPadOS 13+, macOS 11+, tvOS 13+, watchOS 7+.
- Zero runtime dependencies.
